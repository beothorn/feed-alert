Will show an alert when the title of the first entry of a rss feed changes.  
This is a very simple solution for webapps to notify about changes.  

[Download latest](https://github.com/beothorn/feed-alert/releases/download/1.0-SNAPSHOT/feed-alert-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)  
Run with `java -jar <latest jar release>`

This is the add entry dialog:
